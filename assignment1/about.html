    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello Reader! My name is Sarah, a sophomore at Amherst College doubling in English and Computer Science (do these majors make sense to me either? Not really. I'm just in a constant state of denial all the time). I am currently interested in a bunch of different subjects, such as: relational databases, experimental writing, Asian American narratives, children's publishing, education, & digital writing.
    </p>
    <p> Speaking of writing... take a look at this cool <a href="https://bwr.ua.edu/project/food-chain-by-jasmine-an/">poem</a> here. It allows the user to be interactive with the poem, separating the two sides. This allows for both entaglement and distinction of meanings of these two (or one?) textsâ€”similar to how identity can be both an individual and universal (?) experience.</p>

    <h3>What I am thinking right now!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AaaaaaaaaaaaAAAaaAAA<b>aaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</b></li>
      <li>Google Calendars is such a great invention. I would even dare to say that it's a greater invention than toast, which is quite a compliment.</li>
      <li>Potatoes have eyes and clocks have hands. If humans decided to create a clock potato, would it be on its way to becoming a human?</li>
      <li>Hungry. My angry short roommate just got me to do Veggie Febbie, which means that I am currently vegetarian. Which means for breakfast, I had to get a banana instead of the bacon (and I love bacon). I am absolutely devastated, I tell you. <em>Devastated.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Yup...</h3>
    <p> Unfortunately, this is legitimately what my brain is 99.8% of the time. It's like opening Pandora's Box. But with a lot of screaming (though I'm sure the real Pandora's Box also has a lot of screaming). </p>

    <h3> Here are some projects I'm working on! :)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>AILA & AI Club:</b> Spreading the word of AI and ML to use in computational creative works! </li>
      <li><b>Small Press Database:</b> Working on a database to research small publishing presses beyond the Big Five! We discuss topics such as the nature of archives, the ethics of tagging, and the standardization that goes into library catalogs such as <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a>.</li>
      <li>A billion litmags and student magazines! This includes <em>The Common</em>, <em>The Indicator</em>, <em>The Student</em>... There is a cool literary event, called LitFest, happening in a few weeks!! A bunch of well-known authors are coming to campus, so I highly highly suggest checking them out.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I should probably start a more formal website that has a more resume-like format... but this is more entertaining. :) I'll probably start that at another time. Or when I'm procrastinating on another project.</p>
