            <h2>The Indicator</h2>
            <p>Originally founded in 1848, with the mission “to indicate the literary taste, spirit, and acquirements of the undergraduates of Amherst College,” The Indicator was resurrected in 1996 after a 145-year hiatus. While its form and style have shifted over the decades, The Indicator currently publishes one themed edition per semester and accepts a range of creative works including art, short stories, poetry, and more. </p>
